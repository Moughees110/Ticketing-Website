          Frequently Ask Questions Traviazo
        </h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
          Why are the rates of flights slightly expensive as compared to buying
          a ticket directly from the airlines? How can we pay for our tickets?
          When and how could I receive my tickets? If I need to cancel or change
          my ticket, what should I have to do? To buy a ticket, could I use
          someone else’s credit card? Why does a price of ticket is shown but at
          the time when we want to book or buy a ticket it shows that out of
          stock ticket of that date? How could we contact you? WHY ARE THE RATES
          OF FLIGHTS SLIGHTLY EXPENSIVE AS COMPARED TO BUYING A TICKET DIRECTLY
          FROM THE AIRLINES? These tickets are slightly expensive, but they work
          out to be mostly the same as the tickets you buy directly from the
          airline. With our booking, you can get special privileges like special
          meal boxes; you can also get superior accommodation assignments and
          you can get almost always frequent circular mileage. The biggest
          advantage of these tickets booked through us is that these are
          refundable and could be canceled at any time but with a penalty.

          HOW CAN WE PAY FOR OUR TICKETS?
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
          You can receive your tickets within 24 hours by email after receiving
          full payment. Electronic tickets will be sent to clients via e-mail
          that they must print them and carry with them at the airport. In case
          that the customers require printed itinerary, then the prints would be
          delivered through courier/post and in that situation, suitable charges
          will be mentioned at the time of booking.

          IF I NEED TO CANCEL OR CHANGE MY TICKET, WHAT SHOULD I HAVE TO DO?
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
          Before the departure of flights, you can cancel or change your ticket
          by simply talking to our Customer relation representative over the
          phone or you can also write them an e-mail to cancel your ticket. If
          we do not receive any remaining payments within 72 hours of the
          booking, then the reservation will automatically be canceled. All the
          tickets are issued on the basis of non-refundable and non-endorsable
          unless stated otherwise.

          TO BUY A TICKET, COULD I USE SOMEONE ELSE’S CREDIT CARD?
        </h3>

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
          Yes, you can pay the deposit amount to reserve a ticket with someone
          else’s credit card or debit card, but you cannot pay the full amount
          on it for your ticket. You could only pay deposit but the rest of the
          amount you must pay by transferring money in our bank account.

          WHY IS A FLIGHT SHOWING AVAILABLE SEATS BUT AT THE TIME WHEN WE WANT
          TO BOOK OR BUY A TICKET, IT SHOWS THAT OUT OF STOCK TICKET OF THAT

          Our search engine is somehow different from others’, so in that case,
          we give you an opportunity to see the lowest prices we usually offer
          on that sector have without taking any availability to account. Then
          the next step is to analyze the availability of space for that
          particular fare. In this way, you can come to know the market price of
          it. If that flight is not available, then you can change the fare or
          simply you can select the higher fare.
