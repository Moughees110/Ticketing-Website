          Reservations shall be made over telephone, in person, online or by
          mail without any obligation. Reservation is followed by confirmatory
          email from consultant to the traveler (provided that the correct email
          address is given in time). The confirmatory email contains detailed
          traveler information, schedule, payment, company contact and terms &
          conditions. Flight Reservation / schedule and details have to be
          confirmed/replied by both parties in written (where applicable) within
          24 (regular) to 48 hours (exceptional case) of reservation. For
          reservations made over the Internet, full payment is normally required
          at time of reservation unless specifically stated in the booking
          process. In cases where full payment is not made at the time of
          purchase, THE MINIMAL DEPOSIT PAYABLE IS 100 � . The initial deposit
          is non-refundable and is required within 24 hours of reservation to
          ensure Travel Consultancy services and maintain seat Reservation.
          Tickets are only issued once agreed, replied or confirmed by the
          traveler. Issued tickets are non-refundable, non-changeable and
          non-transferable (unless specified). Traviazo are issued and sent via
          email once full payment is made before deadline / ticket time limit /
          expiry and after schedule/itinerary is confirmed by traveler in
          written and any/all document (in case of third-party card) are
          provided. In cases, where no email address is provided, the traveler
          may visit the office in person to collect tickets or request tickets
          in post (mailing/post may take less/more than 72 working hours). The
          confirmatory email sent after telephonic / online reservation and
          payment is “not a proposal” and signifies that the buyer and the
          seller “are in contract” as stated in the email, at details and cost
          as provided and agreed between both parties. However, a traveler may
          request corrections (if any) in response to the email ASAP / same day.
          After the initial deposit, the traveler can continue making part
          payments weekly / monthly or make the full remaining payment at the
          given date / before deadline. There will be no contract between the
          seller and the buyer until the card is charged or payment is made. In
          cases where wrong card / payment information is provided or card
          declined or third-party card forgery/fraud is suspected, no contract
          will apply. All or any call may be recorded for quality purposes.
          Customer feed backs, survey information or communication may also be
          used for marketing, public information or where required. However,
          customer personal information / payment details are only discussed
          with the customer him/herself (if adult or guardian). In case of
          technical errors in online reservation, considering that to be
          systematic in nature, no contract will exist between you and company.
          While in case of Phonetic errors, the Verification Officer may utilize
          all sources and take a decision in the best interest of the traveler
          and the organization. The company may require / demand all third-party
          card verification documents where any traveler has a different name
          than that given on the card, or where a friend / company or family is
          making payment for or on behalf of a traveler. The third-party card
          documents are strictly required for your financial security and to
          protect our customers from misuse of lost/stolen cards through online
          / phone reservations. Any third party using a card on different name
          is required to abide by the third-party terms and conditions as
          communicated through the concerned agent / consultant at the time of
          reservation/payment/use of third-party card. A traveler who fails to
          provide all third-party card documents / bank verifications timely
          will be charged of cancellation OR tickets will not be issued if the
          company’s verification Officer is not satisfied with the documents /
          evidence provided. For Adult travelers, travel information / details
          will only be communicated, discussed or responded to the traveler
          her/himself. Parents/ Guardians can discuss the travel details of
          Infant / Child / minors / Senior Citizen (above 60) / Special or
          disable persons, provided that the reservation is made by parent /
          guardian directly. The deposit is deducted from the total ticket cost
          i.e. the first Deposit is also a part of payment towards total ticket
          cost. Upon final payment the flight schedule and price as
          applicable/available on date of full payment/confirmation is
          resend/communicated to the traveler for reconfirmation/difference
          payment prior ticket issuance. Incase if schedules/flight
          details/price are rejected or objection by the traveler after purchase
          and before tickets issuance (at the time of 1st confirmatory email),
          considering if there is a valid reason, the travel consultant will
          provide/inform any/all alternate flight options to best suit
          traveler’s priorities. However, some flights/reservations may not be
          transferable or changeable depending on airline / destination and
          cancellation charge may apply. For regular or Deposit reservations, if
          at the time of ticket issuance, the airline schedule is
          changed/revised or if the airline is no more available/operating, or
          incase if any currency fluctuation, tax or fare difference has
          occurred during the course or applicable, the traveler will be
          notified. In such cases, (if required) alternate flight options will
          also be offered and payment can be adjusted in new flights at
          fare/cost difference as applicable and payable by the traveler. Fares,
          Taxes or any charges may be revised by airline or governing body at
          any instance unless the tickets are confirmed in writing, documents
          provided, fully paid for and issued same day. In case of late

          confirmations, late third-party card document submission, airline
          policy change, fare/tax revision etc. the availability of fares is
          inductive and confirmed on full payment, at same day of ticket
          issuance. A secondary Schedule verification may also be sent at the
          time or prior ticket Issuance, if required. Any/all matters related to
          cost / schedule/name/transits should be settled before ticket issuance
          and the agency will not be liable / accountable once the business is
          over between the seller and the buyer and the product
          (ticket/accommodation voucher) is delivered. Cancellation will be
          charged if change factors are external (other than company itself) or
          if the Flights are cancelled by traveler her/himself on free will or
          other reasons. The cancellation charges before ticket issuance are
          those as stated in company policy, while cancellation charged after
